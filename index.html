											<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
										</header>
										<p><b>Interest in IT</b>: The main reason I am interested in I.T is because there is a lot of different elements I can learn and find out, when I was younger I was always interested on how things worked and since I always enjoyed using computers,
										    I wanted to gain more knowledge about I.T, this interest increased during a career day at school where I spoke to a web developer and Programmer about what their job role was like and realised that it Is 
											a field I can certainly see myself in due to the flexibility and being able to learn and do new things on a regular basis and that It won’t be just a job but something I enjoy.  
                                            I have basic I.T experience that I learnt in Primary school and doing basic online courses during secondary school. </p>
										<p><b>Why did I choose IT?</b>: I chose RMIT for several reasons one of them being the good reputation they have around I.T courses and how they are much more flexible and more practical then other universities, 
										    RMIT also stood out to me when I went here for the open day and saw the location on the campus and the services available to students making it a university not just about study but also with social elements and future work skills,
										    I also have friends in higher years they recommended it. </p>
										<p><b>Expectation of studies</b>: As I chose a course where I can choose several different I.T electives my expectations is being able to gain skills in different areas in I.T such as Programming and knowledge of computer systems,
										also being able to learn about minor areas such as game development or security that will help me gain a wide range of skills 
										that I can learn in the future. I also Expect a lot of more practical learning gaining hands on skills but also the theory areas of what I am learning, at the end I believe finishing computing studies will give me the skills and knowledge to get a job in the I.T industry </p>

									advanced I.T degree, even though it does include some client interaction which includes going to a clients house the main part of the job will be working on the company’s or clients different technologies and even working on projects.
                                    For me the pay wasn’t the main thing I wanted in a job it would be one where I can learn new skills while working and be able to work independently but also in a team. This job also isn’t a 9-5 job it does include after hour works which is something 
									I wouldn’t mind doing. Th location is something has well I wanted a job in the city and the office is in port Melbourne it also does include travelling around Melbourne. </p>

									<p><b> What do these results mean to me?</b>On a personality level they do feel accurate however the results do not really affect me however they are helpful on deciding what would be a good future job and how I act around other people. 
									The learning styles are more important as it will help me when studying, as I can use a tactile way to help me, it also helps in group work as I know I will be more hands on.</p>
                                    <p><b>How would these results influence my behaviour in a group?</b>These results influence my behaviour in a group as I would prefer to be the one that has been given a task then making the decision myself, I also might take longer to speak openly depending on the group however 
									I do make sure I get the work finished especially if it is more flexible and creative then something I may find repetitive, I make decisions using both my mind and emotions but when it comes down to it I would prefer to make a more logical decision. Even though I am organised and ensure that
									something is done on time I normally don’t plan instead give my self a time frame on what needs to be done and will work out what to do on the way. I don’t normally make decisions on my own or take the lead, but I am willing to if it is a group decision. My learning style is tactile which means 
									I prefer more hands-on work and would begin to get distracted if I do the same thing for a long.</p>
									<p><b>How would these be considered when a forming a group?</b>These should be taken into account as I would need to form a group with people I feel comfortable talking around if that happens then 
									I would be willing to make more decisions rather then allowing someone else to how ever I still prefer being given something to do then making the choice myself even 
									if I am organised I don’t normally follow a set plan but would be willing to if the group chooses to. Otherwise I don’t really mind who I work with

								 <h2>Project idea</h2>
								 <p>The project idea is a new mail system that can be used when people purchase item online. When purchases are made online a tracking number is given however this only shows the predicted day the order will be delivered, my idea is for each delivery to have 
								 a mini GPS tracker that will give users the exact location where their delivery is and how far away it is from their home 
								 including how many days or hours it will be. This new system will also include the option of choosing three days when they want it delivered and to digitally write their signature using a code sent to their phone, this mail system will be in form of a new app.</p>
								 <p>Being an online shopper myself, I dislike not knowing the exact day and time my delivery will come especially if I’m not home and since most websites need a signature it means having to go to the post office. According to statista 1.79 billion people purchased something online, 
								 with the top three being clothes, shoes and electronic appliances most needing a signature, a lot of people also choose to buy furniture or appliances that will have someone coming to install it this why by having a system that not only gives them the day but also time it saves people
								 having to wait around for their delivery to come and for the people that work all day by giving them the option to choose the day or to give their sign signature online allowing them to not have to take the trip to the post office especially for the people in areas which may not have many close by.</p>
								 <p>The mail system will have two aspects an app in which the user will use which will give them all their information and allow them to complete aspects of it and a miniature GPS system which will be placed in their parcel giving them the exact location and time of where their parcel is. When a person purchases their item,
								 they can choose to use this system when choosing delivery option at a extra cost, they would need to make a account ensuring they have the correct address and tracking number. This system can be used for all items across the world however not all aspects will not be available. The main feature is the tracking system which will gives 
								 them a map of where their delivery is at any time of the day and will be updated at all times it will give them the exact day the delivery comes and a time (For example will arrive in 36 hours, 7 minutes approximately 12:36 on Tuesday 3rd) however if delays do happen they will be notified immediately, by giving them the time and day it
								 allows them to organise someone to be home if it is a big delivery or one that needs a signature, also for the people that are waiting impatiently it will let them know it is coming soon.</p>
								 <p>This does not take the risk of delays however they will be notified when normally they won’t. Another aspect is choosing a day in which this will be delivered this will only be available for items needing a signature or which will be needing to be installed however to take the risk of delays or circumstances making it late,
								 the user will be give a option of three days and in most cases will be their first option however due to the availability of mail workers they can not choose the exact time or weekends/public holidays. This will be done through the app and will only become available when their delivery is at the closest post office or delivery point there is a
								 option to cancel of change days but this must be done by 8am the next morning. For smaller items (Does not include electrical appliances or purchases made over $300 for security reasons) they will have the opportunity to write their signature only if they are not home this will be done through the app and they will be notified of this on delivery day 
								 however to ensure this is secure they will be given a code sent to their phone that they must put in they must also answer three security questions they put in when registering to use this, however to make sure security is used the code will change each day this allow for their delivery to be left somewhere safe however for large purchases they will need someone 
								 to be home due to the safety of leaving something valuable out the front door this is why they are given the day and time so they can have someone waiting to collect it for them however the person who purchased will need to do the signature on line and leave the details of the person collection unless they are from the same address or they are given the choice of days so they can ensure they are home.</p>
								 <p>The tracker for the parcels will be a pre made Mini GPS tracker or Mini GPS GSM tracker that will be put in the parcel and can be replaceable. The software needed to make the app will be an app developer such as appery or MIT app developer that will make the app available on android, apple and windows, programming will also be needed. The skills required would mainly be app development and programming the app
								 to be capable of completing the tasks that are needed, as the app will involve a lot including a tracking system that will need to be connected to a tracker, skills will be needed to ensure that is possible and that the app will run properly. The app will also need to be connected the postage system, so there will be a level of challenge to develop this.</p>
								 <p>The successful outcome would be that the tracking of the delivery will be accurate and that the time and date will be correct, the issues to begin with can be issues with the tracking system but overtime this should not be an issue and users will be content about the time and day of their delivery. The other aspects such as choosing the date will be successful if cancellations and change of days only happen due
								 to extreme weather or circumstances out of the post offices control. Another issue could be the security of the online signature which some people may be hesitant to use however by ensuring security answers must be answer and a code is sent this can make people less cautious to use it. The impact of this app is that it will be helpful for people who aren’t at home or for people who want to know when their delivery comes.</p>
