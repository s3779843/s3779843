											<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
										</header>
										<p><b>Interest in IT</b>: The main reason I am interested in I.T is because there is a lot of different elements I can learn and find out, when I was younger I was always interested on how things worked and since I always enjoyed using computers,
										    I wanted to gain more knowledge about I.T, this interest increased during a career day at school where I spoke to a web developer and Programmer about what their job role was like and realised that it Is 
											a field I can certainly see myself in due to the flexibility and being able to learn and do new things on a regular basis and that It won’t be just a job but something I enjoy.  
                                            I have basic I.T experience that I learnt in Primary school and doing basic online courses during secondary school. </p>
										<p><b>Why did I choose IT?</b>: I chose RMIT for several reasons one of them being the good reputation they have around I.T courses and how they are much more flexible and more practical then other universities, 
										    RMIT also stood out to me when I went here for the open day and saw the location on the campus and the services available to students making it a university not just about study but also with social elements and future work skills,
										    I also have friends in higher years they recommended it. </p>
										<p><b>Expectation of studies</b>: As I chose a course where I can choose several different I.T electives my expectations is being able to gain skills in different areas in I.T such as Programming and knowledge of computer systems,
										also being able to learn about minor areas such as game development or security that will help me gain a wide range of skills 
										that I can learn in the future. I also Expect a lot of more practical learning gaining hands on skills but also the theory areas of what I am learning, at the end I believe finishing computing studies will give me the skills and knowledge to get a job in the I.T industry </p>

									<p><b>Why this role appeals to me?</b>:This role appeals to me because I would like a I.T job which has a lot of different responsibilities to do daily and to not do the same thing which this one does as it is to be a technical support 
									I know there will be different issues to resolve, different programs to install and different needs for each client. This role also includes on job training and the opportunity to process into higher positions without having to get a more
									advanced I.T degree, even though it does include some client interaction which includes going to a clients house the main part of the job will be working on the company’s or clients different technologies and even working on projects.
                                    For me the pay wasn’t the main thing I wanted in a job it would be one where I can learn new skills while working and be able to work independently but also in a team. This job also isn’t a 9-5 job it does include after hour works which is something 
									I wouldn’t mind doing. Th location is something has well I wanted a job in the city and the office is in port Melbourne it also does include travelling around Melbourne. </p>
